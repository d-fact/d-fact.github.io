Some extractors are language-independent, i.e., do not process code or irrelavent to language features, such as those generating facts about hunk dependency.
hunk dependency
history dependency
Other extractors are language-dependent, which usually rely on part of the toolchain of specific languages.</description></item><item><title>Atomic Changes</title><link>https://d-fact.github.io/factbase-site/ext/diff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d-fact.github.io/factbase-site/ext/diff/</guid><description> Java Facts about atomic changes of Java projects are extracted by Modified CSlicer.

Both are language-neutral and can be used with any git repos. Hunk Dependency Hunk dependency facts extractor is implemented based on CSlicer.
