#+TITLE: Facts Helper
#+weight: 30

Python scripts are developed as helpers for running various experiments 
using facts. 

They can be browsed [[https://bitbucket.org/liyistc/gitslice/src/facts/resources/facts/facts-utils][here]], or you have had them if you have cloned [[../cslicer][Modified CSlicer]].

** Usage
	Before using, change =BASE_DIR= in =factutils/hislicing/env_const.py= to the local path of CSlicer.
	
*** Install in the virtual env
	#+begin_src sh
% python3 -m venv <DIR>
% source <DIR>/bin/activate
# install in the same pth of setup.py
% pip3 install -e .
	#+end_src

*** Prepare data
	The =--prepare= process will generate correct configuration files according to your =BASE_DIR= and download all project repos.
	#+begin_src sh
# make sure your venv is activated
% python3 -m hislicing.main --prepare
	#+end_src

*** History Slicing
**** Run original CSlicer for History Slicing
	#+begin_src sh
# make sure your venv is activated
% python3 -m hislicing.main --cslicer ../../data/name_eval.json
	#+end_src

**** Collect facts for History Slicing
	#+begin_src sh
# make sure your venv is activated
% python3 -m hislicing.main --fact ../../data/group_eval.json
	#+end_src
