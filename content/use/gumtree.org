** Use AST from clang instead of cgum
   A parser, named [[https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/cgum/][cgum]], is used in GumTree to generate AST in XML for C programs.
   For facts interoperability, we use AST generated by Clang instead of cgum's. 
   
** Changes to GumTree
+ New =TAFormatter= extends =ActionFormatter=, output atomic changes as facts in TA format.
+ Use our AST emitter based on Clang instead of cgum/srcml for C/C++.
+ Change some IO related mechanism
