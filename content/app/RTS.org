#+TITLE: Regression Test Selection
#+weight: 30

A simplified RTS process is described as follows.

First we find out all program entities directly or indirectly call/reference/... into the 
changed entities.

#+begin_src 
allchange = Update + Insert + Delete;
alldeps = call + contain + reference;
affected = (alldeps*) . (dom allchange);
#+end_src

Next we filter out test classes using intersection.
#+begin_src 
testClazz = dom TestClass;
affectedTestclass = testClazz ^ affected;
#+end_src

Abstract classes are removed and their subclasses are selected.
#+begin_src 
affectedAbstract = affectedTestclass ^ (dom AbstractClass)
result = affectedTestclass . (inv Inherit) + affectedTestclass - affectedAbstract
#+end_src
