#+TITLE: Change Impact Analysis
#+weight: 20

We implement Change Impact Analysis on the library upgrade scenario,
where we try to find out the client classes affected by a library upgrade.

This experiment is done to implement a light-weight solution for the 
[[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3238147.3238178][upgrade compatibility checking]] problem:

+ Using facts and query scripts to find out the client classes affected by the 
library upgrade;

+ Running facts-guided test generation, i.e., guide test generator 
  ([[https://github.com/EvoSuite/evosuite][EvoSuite]] was used)
  to only use these affected test classes as the test targets;

+ Compare the results of guided test generation with those original EvoSuite,
measuring how many test generation targets are pruned. The more classes pruned,
the fewer test generation targets needed to be handled, leadingt to greater
improvement on the efficiency.

Scripts for running experiments are also included in [[https://bitbucket.org/liyistc/gitslice/src/facts/resources/facts/evosuite-eval-pipeline/run-pipeline.py][bitbucket:gitslice/run-pipeline.py]].

** Subjects
Ten <cli, lib, lib'> tuples are selected from the [[https://dblp.org/rec/conf/issre/GyoriLHM18.html][library upgrade dataset]]
created by Gyori et al.  The selection criterion is for each tuple, upgrading
lib to lib' should make at least one developer-written test of the cli flip from
pass (✔) to fail (✘).  
We use this criterion because it guarantees that all the subjects
we select for sure have upgrade compatibility issues.

In the results table:

+ *#CC* is the total number of the classes of cli;
+ *#AC* is the number of cli classes affected by the upgrade from lib to lib';
+ *%Reduction* is the reduction rate of the test generation targets achieved by
  differential fact-guided test generation, computed as (#CC - #AC) / #CC;
+ *#T* is the number of generated test methods;
+ *#FT* is the number of generated test methods that flip from pass to fail after
  the upgrade from lib to lib.

The results show that compared with the default test generation approach of
EvoSuite, our differential fact-guided test generation achieves a 78.45% average
reduction rate of test generation targets.  The maximum and minimum reduction
rate are 99.11% and 27.37%, 1148 respectively. On seven of ten subjects, the
reduction rate is over 90%.
