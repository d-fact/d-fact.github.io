#+title: Extractors
#+weight: 20

Extractors are used to produce "basic" knowledge (facts) about input (source code, bytecode, VCS logs, etc.)
in textual formats so that they can be used in next phase processing or analyses.

Some extractors are language-independent, i.e., do not process code or
irrelavent to language features, such as those generating facts about hunk
dependency.

+ [[file:hunkdep][hunk dependency]]
+ [[file:hunkdep][history dependency]]

Other extractors are language-dependent,
which usually rely on part of the toolchain of specific languages.

Currently, extractors for C/C++ and Java collecting following
+ [[file:diff][Atomic changes]]
+ [[file:static][Static dependency]]
+ [[file:test][Test coverage]]

Thanks to the design that decouples facts extraction and analyses,
extractors can be implemented using any language.
