Commits dependency facts include hunk dependency and plain history dependency.
Both are language-neutral and can be used with any git repos.  

** Hunk Dependency
Hunk dependency facts extractor is implemented based on CSlicer.
See [[../../use/cslicer][Usage: CSlicer]] for guide on building modified CSlicer
from source.

  #+begin_src sh
java -jar "target/cslicer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar" -c CONFIG_FILE -e fact --ext hunk
  #+end_src

** History Dependency
   History facts represent git commit history graph in facts.
   Use [[https://github.com/d-fact/ext-gitfacts][github/d-fact/ext-gitfacts]] for this purpose.
