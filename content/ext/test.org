   + Building projects with =--coverage= and =-fprofile-abs-path= and there would be
     note files (=*.gcno=)
   + After running tests, there would be count data files (=*.gcda=). 
   + Invoke =gcov-helper report= would call =gcov= on those files to generate
     coverage files (=*.gcov= or =*.gcov.json=)
   + Invokde =gcov-helper ta=, which instruct =clang-node-finder=
	 (a libtooling-based tool) to generate TA facts from coverage data

   =gcov-helper= and =clang-node-finder= are included in
