* Software Evolution Management with Differential Facts 
Differential facts is a uniform exchangeable representation of software changes supporting efficient querying and manipulation, based on the existing concept of program facts. 
Together with intra-version facts, we can store and then analyze abundant information about software evolution, 
thus lots of questions can be answered by querying related facts.

* Facts
  We use Tuple-Attribute languages and Datalog to represent facts.

  See [[fact/fmt][Facts Format]] for details.

* Extractors
  Various extractors are implemented for extracting inter- or intra-version facts from software repos.

  See [[ext/ext][Extractors]] for details.
* Applications
  We demonstrate the use of differential facts on several evolution management tasks.
  
  See [[app][Applications]] for details.
