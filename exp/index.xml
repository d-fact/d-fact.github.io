Test column: &amp;#34;static&amp;#34; means all other facts except coverage information for each functionality, all other numbers such as 288 is the functionality ID used in the DoSC data set, i.e. IO-288.
Three Facts columns (#Fact, Ext, Query): shows number of lines of facts generated, time used for extraction and time used for querying.</description></item><item><title>Lifted Pointer Analysis</title><link>https://d-fact.github.io/exp/lift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d-fact.github.io/exp/lift/</guid><description>Time usage decomposition Lifted analysis on multiple versions consists of three steps:
Extract facts on each version
Merge into version-annotated representation
Run lifted Analysis on version-annotated facts
Time decomposition by each step is shown below:
